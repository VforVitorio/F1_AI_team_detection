# 🏎️ F1 AI Team Detection

**Computer vision project using YOLO to detect and classify Formula 1 teams in race images and videos. The project also estimates and visualizes the distance between cars in real-time, displaying the gap in both meters and seconds, enabling dynamic race analysis.**

---

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains code and notebooks for an AI-powered Formula 1 team detection system. Leveraging the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, the model detects and classifies F1 team cars in images and videos. Additionally, it estimates the distance between cars, providing real-time gap metrics in both meters and seconds. This enables dynamic analysis and visualization for racing events.

> [!WARNING]
> **Model weights are not included in this repository.** You will need to train the models yourself using the provided notebooks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

python 3.10+ torch 2.5.1 torchvision ultralytics 8.3.137 opencv-python numpy pandas

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/F1_yolo_team_detection.git
cd F1_yolo_team_detection
```

### Usage

1. **Model Training:**
   * Open the [YOLO_fine_tune.ipynb](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/victo/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) notebook in Jupyter
   * Adjust parameters as needed
   * Run the cells to train the model
2. **Distance Calculation and Visualization:**
